# Swift Array Index Out of Bounds

This example demonstrates a common error in Swift: an array index out of bounds crash.  Accessing an array element using an index that's greater than or equal to the array's `count` property leads to a runtime error, causing your app to crash.  The solution involves careful index validation before accessing array elements.
